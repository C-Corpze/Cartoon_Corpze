Sup, I'm Cartoon Corpze.

Some nerd who's interested in game development,
image/audio manipulation and machine learning in general.

I do a bit of everything, whether it be Python, Lua, C#, C++, JavaScript/TypeScript or some other language.
Chances are I know at least something about it.

Always interested in learning more about programming languages
and the things I can do with them. :)
Knowledge is power.
